    <p>Biryani, an authentic dish from the southern ends of Asia, overflowing with spices and flavour, has become a social phenomenon, and rightly so. Today we will learn how to cook it in its simplest form, for a serving size of 2.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <uo>
        <li>Half a cup and 2 tablespoons basmati rice</li> 
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li> 
        <li>Quarter cup of standard biryani masala</li>  
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 whole onion (sliced) </li>
        <li>Quarter pound of meat of your choice</li>
        <li>Half a tablespoon plain yogurt</li>
        <li> 1 and a half cups and 2 tablespoons water</li>
    
      </uo>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the basmati rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 30 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add garlic paste and stir</li>
        <li>Add the lamb chops to the skillet; season with salt. Cook and stir the lamb until the meat begins to brown, about 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the yogurt and lemon juice; cover and cook until the lamb is tender, about 15 minutes. Add water as needed to keep the mixture from getting too dry.        </li>
        <li>Bring the rice, 7 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan until the rice is nearly done yet a little chewy, 10 to 15 minutes; drain any excess water.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet; fry the sliced onion in the hot oil until lightly browned</li>
        <li>Layer about half the rice in the bottom of a deep pot with a lid. Spoon the lamb masala over the rice. Spread the fried onion over the lamb masala. Top with the remaining rice. Cover the pot with the lid and place the pot over low heat; cook until the rice is thoroughly cooked, about 15 minutes.</li>

      </ol>
