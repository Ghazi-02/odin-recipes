Heading and sub headings to represent key concepts and ideas.
Paragraphs to seperate large bodies of texts.
Italics and bold phrases to highlight important information.
Lists, ordered and unordered, to organise information and provide structure to texts.
Hyperlinks and images, to allow access to greater information and pictures to help simplify understanding.
